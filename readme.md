# Mundus Te

Mundus Te, Your World, is an application to view information
about the Earth, it's weather and climate, and the space around it.

## Requirements

Currently there are two required API keys:

* Weather section - [Dark Sky]
(https://darksky.net/dev)
* Satellite section - [N2YO]
(https://www.n2yo.com/)

If running locally, utilize [cors-anywhere]
(https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) package to create an HTTPS proxy,
otherwise remove the proxy addition from fetch requests in services

## Future update ideas

* Weather and climate page
* Earthquake and geological page
* Near earth orbit information page
  * setup notifications when object(s) are overhead
  * create sky map

* Oceanographic page
* Earth sciences news and article sections
